            But haven't you always wanted to be the equivalent of that person
            who somehow always manages to say <strong>"first"</strong> on a
            YouTube video viewed by gajillions within zeptoseconds of uploading?
          </p>
          <p>Think of the clout.</p>
          <p>The kudos.</p>
          <p>The opportunity.</p>
          <p>This is your chance, anon. Rise.</p>
